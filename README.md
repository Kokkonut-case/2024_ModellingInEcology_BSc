The three files inlcuded here were written by small teams of students that participated in the 2024 Theoretical Evolutionary Ecology Bachelors module. Each team was tasked with writing a simple model to test a research question they developed in the first half of the subject. Students were guided by the postdoc coordinators, but the work is their own.
